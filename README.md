+ Created a Ruby on Rails API backend to parse data from a 3rd party API. (Seed data from a complex data set - external API)
+ Use of MVC, Serializers, ActiveRecord, and custom RESTful routes to optimize database and schema for backend functionality. (belongs_to / has_many / belongs_to / has_many_through relationships in model)
+ Validations (when signing up as a new user - username should be unique)
